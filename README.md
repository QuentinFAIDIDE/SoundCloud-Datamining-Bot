EARLY STAGE
As of right now, you can search for a user, generate an activity profile, and search for correlations between those profiles.
The main goal is to be able to make suggestions soon (work in progress).
This correlation score tends to show how many public tracks were exchanged between compared users, as they often both comment, like or repost what they were discussing.
Might be intrusting to dig this way in order to map networks of people.
